## Getting started from scratch

Go to [Angular Local Setup Tutorial](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local) and follow the Prerequisites and Install the Angular CLI steps.

## Start the app

Run `ng serve --configuration=<env>` to start server pointed at aws resources for a specific environment. Available environments are `dev` and `production`. Please provide actual ratings for decks submitted in the production environment. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
